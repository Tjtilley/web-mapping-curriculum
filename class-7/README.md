 Homework
For your class journal (2 points each):
Web app cartography For the following prompts, please read through the cartography presentation here.

1. Color plays a significant role in the visualization of map data. What are some important considerations to keep in mind when choosing the appropriate color scheme for your map?

Colors should go with what data you are trying to visualize. For example if you have sequential data that starts low and goes high using one color that ranges from light to dark, like light blue progressing to dark blue, will help the user understand the map and data being visualized.

2. Why might you want to avoid using a rainbow color scheme?

Rainbow color schemes are missused often and try to show sequential or diverging data using qualitative volors. IT is also hard to tell which color represents a greater value.

3. List and describe 2-3 different thematic map types

- Choropleth

This map shows intensity of data by using a shaded color in proportion. This can be used to show population density.

- Heatmap

This map can show denisty of points and is seperate from zoom factors. This could be used to show fires in an area.

- Hexbin

This map can demonstrate general themes through out a region. This is different from choropleth maps because density is not constrained by boundaries.


4. What type of data is appropriately respresented by a sequential color scheme? What about a diverging color scheme?

Sequential schemes work best with quantitative data that does not need focus drawn to a certain range. Diverging schemes work best with data that has a critical midpoint and has data above and below.

5. Can you name any tools (either from the presentation or your web travels) that would be helpful for choosing colors?

Color brewer is a website that can help choose map colors. It asks for number of data classes, nature of data and color cheme options to help you pick colors for your map.


CORS and working with external data

1. In your own words, describe why web map developers have to think about CORS.

CORS is cross orign resource sharing and web map developers need to think about it because if a file linked to your web map gets moved it may break and cause problems.

2. What is the concept of "separation of concerns?"

Separation of concerns means separating out ceratin peices of the web map. Common separations include style and presentation, business logic and content. A reason you would want to do this is because the different pieces are usually independently changed.


Code exercises to do on your own (10 points):
This exercise is more open-ended than usual and we encourage you to be as creative as you like!

Find a GeoJSON file hosted somewhere online (other than the ones we've used in this class!). Some good places to look: http://geojson.xyz/, the SF data portal, data.gov, awesome-geojson.
Using the techniques we covered in Class 7, add the data you found to a map and give it some style.
Commit your file to your forked class repo.
Open an issue in your forked class repo with the title, "Class 7 code homework" and include a link to your working map.


Project

Next week, you'll present your projects to the class. The following week, your final projects and project reports are due. Please see the rubrics in the project directory for more details.
