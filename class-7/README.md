 Homework
For your class journal (2 points each):
Web app cartography For the following prompts, please read through the cartography presentation here.

1. Color plays a significant role in the visualization of map data. What are some important considerations to keep in mind when choosing the appropriate color scheme for your map?

2. Why might you want to avoid using a rainbow color scheme?

3. List and describe 2-3 different thematic map types

4. What type of data is appropriately respresented by a sequential color scheme? What about a diverging color scheme?

5. Can you name any tools (either from the presentation or your web travels) that would be helpful for choosing colors?

CORS and working with external data

1. In your own words, describe why web map developers have to think about CORS.

2. What is the concept of "separation of concerns?"


Code exercises to do on your own (10 points):
This exercise is more open-ended than usual and we encourage you to be as creative as you like!

Find a GeoJSON file hosted somewhere online (other than the ones we've used in this class!). Some good places to look: http://geojson.xyz/, the SF data portal, data.gov, awesome-geojson.
Using the techniques we covered in Class 7, add the data you found to a map and give it some style.
Commit your file to your forked class repo.
Open an issue in your forked class repo with the title, "Class 7 code homework" and include a link to your working map.


Project
