3. In HTML, does the order of elements matter? Why?

4. When might you need to use an array? How about an object?


Code exercises
Skill practice (5 points) The following exercise uses an interactive code editing tool called repl.io. The links below will take you to a page with some code practice. It includes some guiding explanation as well as a set of exercises (each denoted with a number in square brackets, like [1]) for you to try. After you type some code into the pane on the left, you can click the "run" button to execute your code. Once you're satisfied with your code, you can turn in the exercise by opening an issue in your forked version of the class repo with the title "Class 4 code practice." Your issue can include either: copied and pasted code or a "share" link.

Project
Your data report is due next week. The rubric for your data report is below. To turn in your data report, commit a new markdown file called "data-report.md" to your forked class repo in the project folder. As a reminder, the data report comprises 15 of the 70 possible points for your final project.

Your data report must include:

Description the problem and objectives.
List of datasets, including each dataset’s source.
Description of each datasets’ meaning and purpose
Define the need for each of the datasets. How do each of the datasets help you meet your objectives?
Are there additional datasets that would help you meet your objectives? What barriers exist that prevent you from incorporating those datasets?
Detailed description of your methodology:
Describe steps required to prepare data for use in web map. How will you need to transform the data? Do you need to combine it with other kinds of data? Does it need to be reformatted in any way?
For each dataset, description of how the data will be displayed on your web map. What kinds of UI elements and interactions will you need to build for your user to understand each dataset?

Complete your project sketches 

Everyone produced some quick, low-fidelity project sketches for class. For next week, each project group should produce two medium-fidelity sketches, each conveying one of your possible final project designs. To turn in your medium-fidelity sketches, bring them to class next week.

Your medium-fidelity sketches should include:

More detailed drawings of each element on the page.
For elements that aren't immediately visible, like hidden map layers, interactions, or other items that are difficult to convey via sketch, include descriptions or diagrams. These could include arrows, numbered annotations, inset images, or whatever helps convey your ideas.
