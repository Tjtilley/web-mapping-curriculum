            description: 'Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, is used to produce oil and gas. It is done by shooting a mix of toxic chemicals, water and sand into the surface of the Earth loosening rock formations in order to extract the oil and gas. It has been known to pollute local water posing a risk to human health. According to the Center for Biological Diversity fracking can contaminate groundwater through the various toxic chemicals mixed into the water blasted into the Earth. 25% of these chemicals have the potential to cause cancer. Methane associated with the drilling can also contaminate the groundwater.',
